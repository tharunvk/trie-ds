# trie-ds
Implementation of Trie data structure. Insertion, Search, Auto recommendation and Deletion.

I wrote this code myself(you know what I mean :p). I just had the knowlegde of how Trie data structure works. My advice for those who are reading this is to try to code for yourself because, if you wanna know the beauty of recursion then writing code yourself teaches you the intricacies and you'll be able to understand recursion better.

* I have used unordered map in the code just to make it run faster ( coz it uses hash table for searching)
* Auto recommendation basics takes the substring and just calls the search() function to recursively print out all strings starting with that prefix. So it's basically a subset of prefix based searching
* I know there's a few boiler plate code. pardon me. I'm a bit lazy to remove it :P
